lua_utils: Utility classes for Lua in C++
=========================================

This package provides utility classes to interact with a Lua interpreter from
C++. They taken from the Fawkes source tree. The goal of this package is to
allow for a free flow of this code between Fawkes and ROS without the need
for platform-specific changes on code transfer (though there are specific
regions in the code guarded with macros). Keep this in mind when changing
these files.
